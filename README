MapSplit is a tool that can split a map made of a fixed tile size into a smaller tile size.
For example, let's say you have a map made of 32x32 pixels tiles, but your engine or the console your are developping for only accept 8x8 pixels tiles.
MapSplit will convert your map according to that, and the new map will be usable with 8 pixels tiles ! (without modifying the original tileset)

Usage:
mapsplit mapfile.map outfile.map InputTileSize OutputTileSize TileSetWidth [-bigendian | -byte]

The map input and output format is the one made by my tmx2bin tool !

InputTileSize is the tile size of the input map. (exemple 32)
OutputTileSize is the desired tile size for the output map. (exemple 8)
TileSetWidth is the image width of the tileset associated to the map.

Default output is little endian WORD.
v2: Support for BigEndian and Byte mode added (tmx2bin also support these mode)
